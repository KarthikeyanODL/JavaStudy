Maualy solve N/w solution
1.	We have 3 nodes, all assigned IP
2.	When containers are created, k8s create namespace for them
3.	To enable communicate between them we attach these namespaces to the network. Like in Linux – Bridge Network
4.	Create Bridge network in each node and bring them up
5.	Assign Ip to the Bridge Network . we decide each bridge n/w has its own subnet
6.	Assign IP addres for the Bridge Interface
Bridge script
7.	Create a wire/link
8.	Attach the wire one end at the container another end at the bridge
9.	Assign the IP and add the default route – gateway
10.	Bring up the interface
Enable communication between one pod to another pod that is in another Node
11.	Add IP route -> via node 2 . then pod from node1 can be communicate with pod in node2
12.	Add IP route in all the node. 

When kubelet creates the container , it looks for the script and runs the script
