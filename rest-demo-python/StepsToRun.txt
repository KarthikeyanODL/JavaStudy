Restful WebService has two parts Rest Server & Rest Client

Rest Server
-----------

# Step 1. install Rest Server & dependencies
    cd rest-server
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2. Start the Rest Server
    python app.py


Explanation :

We have implemented two Restful Webservice API using python.After implementation, 
we deployed the python code on Flask server.

API -> /api/sites/list  
       /api/{apikey}/sites/list
code -> python
server -> flask running on  port :8888


 Rest Client
------------

we can test the Restful Webservice API with any rest client.
Ex: Browser(only GET request),curl, Postman application, nodejs, python, java, .net, Golang etc.,

We need IP of the server, port and URL of the exposed Rest API
In our case , server and client is running in same machine. so 
IP -> localhost
port -> :8888
API url -> /api/sites/list
       /api/{apikey}/sites/list
 

Rest Client with Curl
----------------------
This is the simplest way to test the API
we can also test the Restful Webservice API with curl command
# Step 3.  run the below command one by one to access the API 
       curl http://localhost:8888/api/sites/list
       curl http://localhost:8888/api/199208/sites/list
here 199208 is the key.

If curl request not working, then either your server is not running or you are doing some mistake to call the server.

Rest Client with Python
-----------------------
we will test the Restful Webservice API using python
# Step 4.  run the below command
    python rest_client_simple.py

# Step 4a(optional) the same program but written with function for good programming practise.
   python rest_client_with_function.py

Thats all, we have tested the exposed REST API with python
